# Mini-Projects-in-Computer-Networks
- Learned about cable design, connecting computers in a LAN, study network devices, basic commands, and analyze diverse network topologies (bus, ring, star, mesh, hybrid) with wired and wireless options.
- Implemented and Simulated encapsulation, authentication protocols, perform multilayer switching, configure IP routing, simulate ARP and RARP, generate network traffic, and understand multiplexing in computer networking.
Projects:
- Connect the computers in Local Area Network, and Study of basic network command and Network configuration commands.
- configure and analyze bus, ring, star, mesh, and hybrid network topology with wired vs wireless networks.
- Study of protocol of encapsulation and authentication protocol in computer networking.
- To Perform multilayer Switching in computer network.
- Configuring IP routing using routing information protocol.
- Simulation of Address Resolution Protocol and Reverse Address Resolution Protocol.
- Generation of network traffic in simulation mode and view multiplexing.
